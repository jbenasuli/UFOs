# UFOs

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project is provide users the ability to search for and analize the data of UFO sightings.

The array of UFO sightings data has been tabulated and added to an HTML webpage allowing users to easily view information regarding each UFO sighting. The table is dynamically constructed with filters for five of the fields giving users the ability to easily drill down their search on up to five criteria.

## Results

Upon loading the webpage, users will see all the UFO sightings data in the table. To refine the results displayed in the table, users can input values for one or more of the filter fields located to the left of the table. Below are screenshots of the webpage with examples of no filter, one filter and all five filters being used in a search.

It is important to note that a field containing light gray text does not indicate a search entry. The light gray values are placeholder values meant to serve as example inputs for users. Additionally, in order for a search input to take affect, users need to press the enter key or click outside the input box.

- No filters: all data is displayed in the table.
